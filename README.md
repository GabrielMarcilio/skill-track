# skill-track
Display a network of skills within a team

I created this project as an excuse to start learning java script. Let see where this will end...

The Idea of the project is the the user can have a graphical representation of a skill network. The user
also should be able to add people and skills to the network, and also register times where he witnessed a people using a skill (interaction).

For now the ideia is to use a graph to represent this network. People and skills wil be nodes, while the interactions will be (valued) edges.
